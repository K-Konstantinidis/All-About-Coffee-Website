# All-About-Coffee-Website

https://k-konstantinidis.github.io/All-About-Coffee-Website/index.html

This is an HTML and CSS website, without the help of Bootstrap. It has 6 different pages, and everything is about coffee.

In the Coffee Survey page, there is no Js, no required attribute and no PHP. That means that there is no validation, so you can write whatever you want in each box but you are also allowed to leave all the boxes empty if you want to.

As staded before, there is no php so when you press send, your input will not be processed and the page will just reload.

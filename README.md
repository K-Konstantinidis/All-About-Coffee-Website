# All-About-Coffee-Website

https://k-konstantinidis.github.io/All-About-Coffee-Website/index.html

This is an HTML and CSS website, without the help of Bootstrap. It has 6 different pages, and everything is about coffee.

In the Coffee Survey page, there is neither Js, nor PHP. That means that there is no validation, so you can write whatever you want in each form field but you are also allowed to leave most of the fields empty if you want to.

The only required fileds are the Name and the Email Adress.

As staded before, there is no php so when you press send, your input will not be processed and the page will just reload.
